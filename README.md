## Description

This web application makes use of the Google Gemini API to generate text from both text-based and image-based inputs. It was originally intended for testing the GPT-4-Vision model, but upon its release, it underwent codebase adaptation to integrate the Gemini API. The application was used as an internal testing platform for the Gemini API within our organization and is no longer in use.
